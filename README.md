Hello, I am Sannidhya Dasgupta. I am a student and know a bit of programming. I like to make programs in python. 
My favourite food is None and my favourite beverage is water `(Hydrogen Peroxide)`. I like linus torvalds, except when it feels like he is coming to punch me in the face for not using kali linux for making my powerpoint presentation on ending world hunger while eating uncle chips. My best friend is Lavly - LavlyGPT, my selfmade ai companion. U can find ma boy in my repos. he is kind of nuts but usually is a conversation killer (litrally)

I have also published a couple of research journals which you can read:

i) Quantum Computation Simulation on Classical computers as a simplified programming language in python and a prototype of “QuantaLang”. [read the paper here](https://www.academia.edu/117483328/Quantum_Computation_Simulation_on_Classical_Computation_as_a_simplified)

ii) Optimized Schedule Generation With Matrices And Priority Queue In Python
